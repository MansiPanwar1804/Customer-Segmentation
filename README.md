# Customer-Segmentation
Using Mall Customer Dataset and performing K-Means Clustering to segregate customers based on the data in form of optimal clusters
Process to be Followed are as :
1. Understanding the dataset 
  -> importing useful and required libraries
  ->we will be briefly understanding our dataset
  ->check for the NULL values 
  -> Preparing data for clustering
2. Perform Elbow method to find optimal number of clusters
   -> using K-Means to iterate from 1 to 11 clusters and plotting a elbow plot 
   ->Deciding optimal number of clusters to be used 
3. Training a model using unsupervised learning algo(K-Means)
   ->Initializing our K-Means model with selected optimal number of clusters
   ->Plot of clusters and gain intuitions regarding our customers
4. Plotting the clusters
