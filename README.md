# Customer-Segmentation
Using Mall Customer Dataset and performing K-Means Clustering to segregate customers based on the data in form of optimal clusters
Process to be Followed are as :
1. Understanding the dataset
2. Perform Elbow method to find optimal number of clusters
3. Training a model using unsupervised learning algo(K-Means)
4. Plotting the clusters

   Customer ----> Data Pre-processing -----> Data Analysis -----> WCSS(optimal number of cluster) -----> K-Means clustering -----> Visualizing the Clustering
